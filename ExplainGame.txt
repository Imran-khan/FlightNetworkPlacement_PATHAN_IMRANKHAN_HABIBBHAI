                                        Game of Elimination:(Using Language c(TURBOC))
					---------------------------------------------
	                                
					This game is implemented using circular linklist.


* Players have two choice while he/she is playing game.


1)START:-
	   once you select this option,it will ask you to enter no. of player(i.e.say M) and his name.After this you have to select a random no.(i.e.say N) which is less than the no. of players in the game(i.e say N<M) and game will start to eliminate player until one which is left in the game and will be declared as winner.
2)QUIT:-
	   To quit the game.


* The algorithm used to implement this game is as followed.

	*For insertion of new node.
		
                procedure insert() 	

		step 1 : if list is empty then new node first=new;
	
			 if(first == null) then
			 first=new1;


		step 2 : if the node  exists then traverse the list upto the last node(Here temp is temporary node for traversal ).

			 temp=first->new1;
	                 while(temp->new1!=first)
     					temp=temp->new1;
     		
     			 new1->new1=temp->new1;
     		         temp->new1=new1;
	
		step 3:  end	
	
	*For deletion of a node(Here nth position is the position of node that we want to delete).
 
                     ==>procedure elimination(nth position)

		step 1:	while(first->new1!=first)
				
				if frist position then
					temp=first->new1;
					
					while(temp!=first)
					prev=temp;
					temp=temp->new1;
					prev->new1=temp->new1;
					first=prev->new1;
					

				else
					temp=first;
					
					for 1 t0 nth position
						prev=temp;
						temp=temp->new1 //end of for
					
					prev->new1=temp->new1;
					first=prev->new1;      	
						
		step 2 : end.
